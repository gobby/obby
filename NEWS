 * Document storage in memory reduced to one central copy which the
   application could provide through a template parameter

 * Changes in the build system:
   - New dependency on GNU MP: The GNU multi precision arithmetic library
     provides big integers which are used to secure the password transmission
     on the wire.
   - New optional dependency on `howl': The howl library is used to provide
     local network service publishing and discover through Zeroconf.
