libobby
=======

This file lists prioritised items which need to be fixed or developed.

Serious:
 * Hide equivalent insert/delete change calls
 * Test libobby under realtime conditions

Important:
 * Call insert/erase signals in *_nosync

Normal:
 * Implement automatic service announcement and discovery
 * Sync-On-Request
 * UTF-8 string handling (Well, do we care about encodings?)
 * Host sends record with user id 0 instead of local user
 * Session serialisation:
   - Load/save documents to/from file and/or memory while preserving history
   - Load/save complete obby session
   - Use XML to serialise a tree of objects

Minor:
 * Implement indent_record and unindent_record to (un)indent lines of text
 * Grep for TODOs in the Code :)

Wishlist:
 * Implement paintchat
